Let's create a basic cookbook to upload to the Supermarket site.  This cookbook will install apache2 and show a custom home page.

(This assumes you have Chef DK installed)

## Creating a Chef Repo

To create a Chef repo, run this command:

```bash
  $ chef generate repo my_chef_repo
```
Then cd into that repo

```bash
  $ cd my_chef_repo
```

## Creating a Cookbook

Since this is a cookbook we're going to upload to the Supermarket site, let's check whether a cookbook already exists with that name on Supermarket.  I want to use the name "my_apache2_cookbook", so to check whether there's already a cookbook with that name on Supermarket I run:


```bash
  $ chef generate cookbook cookbooks/my_apache2_cookbook
```

If I get back a response that "The object you are looking for could not be found", that means that cookbook name is available on Supermarket.  For the rest of this tutorial, I'll use the cookbook name "my_apache2_cookbook".

Now create a cookbook within that repo.

```bash
  $ chef generate cookbook cookbooks/my_apache2_cookbook
```

## Creating a template

Next we'll create a template for our custom home page.

```bash
  $ chef generate template cookbooks/my_apache2_cookbook index.html
```

That will create a file called index.html.erb in the cookbooks/my_apache2_cookbooks/templates/default directory path.

Now open this file with your favorite text editor, I use vim here.

```bash
  $ vim cookbooks/my_apache2_cookbook/templates/default/index.html.erb
```

And enter in some HTML to be displayed.

```bash
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Chef Love!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then save and close the file.

## Creating a recipe

Now open up the default recipe that was created when you generated the my_apache2_cookbook.

```bash
  $ vim cookbooks/my_apache2_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
```
And insert the following content:

```bash
  package 'apache2' # Installs the apache2 package

  service 'apache2' do
    action [:start, :enable] # Starts and enables the apache2 service on boot
  end

  template '/var/www/html/index.html' do
    source 'index.html.erb' # Defines a template for the default home page at /var/www/html/index.html
  end
```

And now we have a very basic cookbook we can upload to Supermarket!
