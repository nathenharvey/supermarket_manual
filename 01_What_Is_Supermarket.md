## What is Supermarket?

There are two versions of Supermarket available today.

### Public Supermarket

Supermarket is Chef's community cookbooks site.  It is a place for Chef community members to download community cookbooks and upload cookbooks to be used by other community members.

Supermarket is also intended to make it easier to participate in Chef's open source projects through Contributor License Agreements (CLA's).  We will cover these later in this manual  [INSERT LINK]

### Private Supermarket

Some of Chef's customers and community members have expressed interest in using Supermarket behind a firewall.  To that end we have created the Chef Supermarket Omnimbus project, which creates full-stack platform-specific packages for Chef Supermarket.
